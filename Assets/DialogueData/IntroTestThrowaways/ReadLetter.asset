  dialogue:
  - You pick up the letter and begin reading.
  - "Dear Mama, I know you\u2019ve always wanted me to have as fine a life as you
    with my father. I\u2019m living in high cotton here. "
  - "Huck is off on another business trip for who knows how long. He\u2019s away
    more than he\u2019s home nowadays;"
  - "though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m all that disappointed to get a break from his
    snorin\u2019. "
  - 'I tell you my husband is hog-calling at night. Calliope can hear it even from
    the maid room across the house. '
  - "He is just like father in that regard. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve put
    up with it this long, mama. "
  - " If listenin\u2019 to him saw logs in bed is the price to stay here then I suppose
    it\u2019s worth it.  I miss you, ma. I hope to see you soon."
  - 'With love


    - Priscilla'
